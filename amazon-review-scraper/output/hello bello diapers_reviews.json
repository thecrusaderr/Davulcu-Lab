I like how thin they are while is absorbent enough. My baby hasn't have any issue with leaking yet. I hope they can have more patterns available on Amazon. The Hello Bello website strangely didn't work and there are way more patterns there."

I tried Hello Bello diapers for the first time on him yesterday and every single diaper leaked to the point it seemed like they weren't even catching anything, requiring a wardrobe change with every diaper. I tried checking the waistband and the leg holes to make sure there was a seal every time I put a new diaper on him, but it made no difference. I swapped back to Pampers and the blowouts and leakage stopped. I won't be using these again. I'd donate them, but I don't want to subject others to the amount of clean up and laundry we have to do now. Just poor performance and caused more cleanup than necessary."

They have cute designs just like Honest does too and for a much better price! I\u2019m happy I tried these for my baby.\n\nI see people in the reviews complain about them not being as absorbent as they would like but personally, I would never keep my baby in even a wet diaper knowing he\u2019s uncomfortable. I have an 11 week old baby that sleeps through the night and he doesn\u2019t wake up in discomfort not once for diaper change but he also rarely soils the diaper at night.\n\nHope this helps other parents!"

As a 2-time cancer survivor, I try my hardest to keep toxins out of my kids' lives, & I've done tons of research into what chemical contents to avoid, bleaching processes, pulp, etc. I am especially wary of the PFAS (forever chemicals) that are now known to be ubiquitous endocrine disruptors. According to a trusted source, these diapers have tested non-detect for fluorine (ehich would be evidence of PFAS), have a plant-based liner and are free of fragrances and lotions. The only concern is that they do use ECF (elemental chlorine-free) pulp, which may not be entirely free of coloring and can still create disinfection byproducts. So these are not top-rated for non-toxicity but they are infinitely healthier than a lot of alternatives. One reason I am giving them five stars is that they do not offgas any smell when I immediately open the plastic, unlike another brand I was using of supposedly equal quality and safety. They also seem to fit my daughter better. The tabs do sometimes stick together on the unopened diapers, but I haven't accidentally torn any. Overall, if you are looking for a disposable that does not expose your child to the highly suspect chemicals and fragrances used by so many \"trusted\" Big brands, these diapers are a great, affordable way to go. I will be switching to this brand until I find one without ECF that is still affordable and manages to keep in stock."

The fit is pretty perfect, and they have a leak indicator that works as expected.\n\nHaven't seen any kind of irritation or rashes from these which is another big plus.\n\nThey do come at a premium price but they seem well worth it. Would recommend if you're having skin issues on a baby/toddler with other diapers, or if you need diapers that you know you can trust to prevent leaks and last for a prolonged duration (like going out on errands and taking longer than expected between changes)."

I haven't had any problems with skin irritation either and the elastic band around the legs does not cause any discomfort. The design is adorable and neutral for boys or girls. The eco-friendliness of these diapers make me feel better than using anything synthetic or \"chemical loaded\". I've used these overnight and neither number 1 or number 2 has escaped.

Not quite as good as the more expensive brands like pampers, but they do a good job for their price. We don't get excited about any design on them, since they are just disposable diapers and are often under clothing, but the design is cute.\n\nThe closure holds tight and have not let go even once. No issue with chaffing or binding around the legs. We like them and will consider them when we have to buy more."

The adorable wild cats print is such a fun touch that makes diaper changes more cheerful.\n\n**Absorbency:** These diapers are highly absorbent and can last through long naps and even overnight without leaks. They do an excellent job of keeping my little one dry and comfortable.\n\n**Fit:** The size 3 diapers fit my baby (17 lbs) perfectly, with a snug yet gentle fit around the waist and legs. The stretchy tabs make it easy to get a secure fit, which prevents leaks while allowing my baby to move freely.\n\n**Softness:** The material is super soft, which is important for sensitive baby skin. We haven\u2019t had any issues with diaper rashes or irritation since switching to Hello Bello.\n\n**Eco-Conscious:** I also love that Hello Bello prioritizes being eco-friendly while maintaining affordability. It\u2019s nice knowing these diapers are made with plant-based ingredients without sacrificing quality.\n\n**Value:** The 100-count value pack is such a great deal. It\u2019s convenient not having to buy diapers as often, and I appreciate the quality at this price point.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend **Hello Bello Diapers** for any parent looking for a high-quality, stylish, and reliable diaper option. It\u2019s a win-win for both baby and parent!"

Super cute! I haven't had any problems with leaks (even after long days away from home with my baby when it's hard to get regular diaper changes done). Sometimes other brands I use have scratchy spots on the waistband that irritate my baby's skin, but I haven't noticed problems with these. The tabs for securing the diaper haven't torn or come off which is also nice to not have to deal with in the middle of a frantic, wiggly diaper change battle! I'd say these are definitely some of the better diapers I've used."

The design includes a doody-catcher feature but I do think the huggies brand it's better in that area.\n\nAs per sizing they seem to run small based on the size chart, so you might want to consider going up a size if your toddler is on the larger end.\n\nIt\u2019s important to notice that these diapers are free from parabens and phthalates as that's something important for some parents and a priority for sensitive skin babies.\n\nWith 84 diapers in the pack, it\u2019s definitely more expensive than high quality name brands like huggies but relatively similar to other organic brands.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with the Hello Bello Diapers as an organic option for everyday use."

They feel soft to the touch and seem to also be soft and comfortable to wear without causing any skin irritations. I still think some of the name brands might be a bit softer but not by significant amounts. The absorbency is good for a thin diaper and holds up to nap times without leaking. The value pack seems to offer a pretty good value, and I love that they are made in the USA and that this company gives back, donating over 7 million diapers and wipes to parents in need. That's awesome!"

They are really soft, truly cloth-like texture, strong Velcro tabs, great elastic leak barriers and have a great gender-neutral star design all over.

At this point, I think it might be time to size up, but there also isn\u2019t a barrier pocket in the back to keep everything in the diaper. My son is 11 pounds so I got a size 1."

And my 8 month old had a leaky diaper after just wearing for 2.5 hours, so definitely wouldn\u2019t trust to have my little ones wear through the night.\nNot only is the quality far lower, but the cost of this pack is double what I pay for R&F for a comparable amount.\nI think the only advantage are these have cuter designs, but I mean my babies\u2019 booties are always covered anyways and the diapers go straight to the trash so I am not super concerned about the look of them.\nThese are fine to have on hand in case you run out or to keep a few in the car for on the go, but I won\u2019t be using these regularly unfortunately"

Additionally, they aren't the easiest to put on. The velcro tabs are the same color as the diaper so figuring out front to back can't be done with a quick glance. This gives my toddler granddaughter just enough time to allegator roll out of position. I need a different color tab or a design element that says \"BACK\" or something. I would get them if I felt super strongly about the toxin issue, but I think I'll reserve that for her food."

First off, the designs are so fun and vibrant. The dinosaurs are perfect for my little explorer, and the colorful parrots are just too cute. It\u2019s always a joy to change diapers when the patterns are this playful!\n\nIn terms of quality, Hello Bello has always impressed me. These diapers are super absorbent and soft on my baby's skin. No leaks, even overnight, and I haven\u2019t noticed any irritation or rashes. I also love that they\u2019re made with plant-based materials and free from harsh chemicals. It gives me peace of mind knowing I\u2019m using something safe for my baby.\n\nThe sizing is spot on, and they fit comfortably without being too tight. Plus, the stretchy waistband and leg cuffs keep everything snug without being restrictive. I\u2019m definitely a fan of these diapers, and I highly recommend them to other parents looking for quality, eco-friendly, and cute diapers!"

The printed pattern looks cute, and kids seem to like the print. I guess the important thing is they work well. I haven't noticed any signs of leakage or soaking through.

I try to make more sustainable choices when I can, and it\u2019s nice to see a diaper company leading the charge in that department.\nThat being said, my only gripe with these diapers is that they could be a bit thicker. They\u2019re super soft, but sometimes I feel like they don\u2019t absorb as much as I\u2019d like, especially overnight."

They have cute designs just like Honest does too and for a much better price! I\u2019m happy I tried these for my baby.\n\nI see people in the reviews complain about them not being as absorbent as they would like but personally, I would never keep my baby in even a wet diaper knowing he\u2019s uncomfortable. I have an 11 week old baby that sleeps through the night and he doesn\u2019t wake up in discomfort not once for diaper change but he also rarely soils the diaper at night.\n\nHope this helps other parents!"

As a 2-time cancer survivor, I try my hardest to keep toxins out of my kids' lives, & I've done tons of research into what chemical contents to avoid, bleaching processes, pulp, etc. I am especially wary of the PFAS (forever chemicals) that are now known to be ubiquitous endocrine disruptors. According to a trusted source, these diapers have tested non-detect for fluorine (ehich would be evidence of PFAS), have a plant-based liner and are free of fragrances and lotions. The only concern is that they do use ECF (elemental chlorine-free) pulp, which may not be entirely free of coloring and can still create disinfection byproducts. So these are not top-rated for non-toxicity but they are infinitely healthier than a lot of alternatives. One reason I am giving them five stars is that they do not offgas any smell when I immediately open the plastic, unlike another brand I was using of supposedly equal quality and safety. They also seem to fit my daughter better. The tabs do sometimes stick together on the unopened diapers, but I haven't accidentally torn any. Overall, if you are looking for a disposable that does not expose your child to the highly suspect chemicals and fragrances used by so many \"trusted\" Big brands, these diapers are a great, affordable way to go. I will be switching to this brand until I find one without ECF that is still affordable and manages to keep in stock."

The 120-count value pack is a fantastic deal, and I love that these diapers are both effective and eco-conscious. Overall, they\u2019re a solid, affordable choice for keeping baby dry and comfortable!"

My baby is living in luxury in these diapers and I'm highly considering switching, they are THAT good. Price is a little more than I'd like to spend, but as parents, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for your child's comfort, and this would be justified. We love them!"

I haven't had any problems with skin irritation either and the elastic band around the legs does not cause any discomfort. The design is adorable and neutral for boys or girls. The eco-friendliness of these diapers make me feel better than using anything synthetic or \"chemical loaded\". I've used these overnight and neither number 1 or number 2 has escaped. I am happy with this and only wish I'd have known sooner. My grandbaby is comfortable and well wrapped in softness around the most sensitive parts."

The adorable wild cats print is such a fun touch that makes diaper changes more cheerful.\n\n**Absorbency:** These diapers are highly absorbent and can last through long naps and even overnight without leaks. They do an excellent job of keeping my little one dry and comfortable.\n\n**Fit:** The size 3 diapers fit my baby (17 lbs) perfectly, with a snug yet gentle fit around the waist and legs. The stretchy tabs make it easy to get a secure fit, which prevents leaks while allowing my baby to move freely.\n\n**Softness:** The material is super soft, which is important for sensitive baby skin. We haven\u2019t had any issues with diaper rashes or irritation since switching to Hello Bello.\n\n**Eco-Conscious:** I also love that Hello Bello prioritizes being eco-friendly while maintaining affordability. It\u2019s nice knowing these diapers are made with plant-based ingredients without sacrificing quality.\n\n**Value:** The 100-count value pack is such a great deal. It\u2019s convenient not having to buy diapers as often, and I appreciate the quality at this price point.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend **Hello Bello Diapers** for any parent looking for a high-quality, stylish, and reliable diaper option. It\u2019s a win-win for both baby and parent!"

The size 4 was true to size and the cute, bright colors and design were the first thing I noticed when I opened the box. They are all over a bright red/orange color with sunflowers all over. Super cute! I haven't had any problems with leaks (even after long days away from home with my baby when it's hard to get regular diaper changes done). Sometimes other brands I use have scratchy spots on the waistband that irritate my baby's skin, but I haven't noticed problems with these. The tabs for securing the diaper haven't torn or come off which is also nice to not have to deal with in the middle of a frantic, wiggly diaper change battle! I'd say these are definitely some of the better diapers I've used."

I was not expecting much and decided to only try the diapers for daytime use.\n\nI have to say that I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with the diapers. We\u2019ve had no blowouts or leaks. Poop seems well contained. The fit is great for my baby, and I love the stretch of the fasteners. I no longer notice a scent, and I actually think it\u2019s for the best that it doesn\u2019t have that baby smell like pampers as it seems free of perfumes that could irritate baby.\nI have since tested these for a full night and they held up.\n\nSide note, my baby likes the star design and points at them.\n\nI recommend testing these for your baby if you\u2019re on the hunt for a good diaper.\nI\u2019ll probably still stick with Millie Moon for regular use because the cost is 35 cents a diaper vs the 43 cents for these Hello Bello diapers."

As a reference I have used most store brands as well as some organic brands as well.\n\nThese diapers standout because of their softness and despite this luxury feel, they hold up pretty well. The design includes a doody-catcher feature but I do think the huggies brand it's better in that area.\n\nAs per sizing they seem to run small based on the size chart, so you might want to consider going up a size if your toddler is on the larger end.\n\nIt\u2019s important to notice that these diapers are free from parabens and phthalates as that's something important for some parents and a priority for sensitive skin babies.\n\nWith 84 diapers in the pack, it\u2019s definitely more expensive than high quality name brands like huggies but relatively similar to other organic brands.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with the Hello Bello Diapers as an organic option for everyday use."

The design makes them perfect for boys or girls. The size 2 (10-16 lbs.) fit as indicated and includes the yellow urine indicator strip on the front like your name brand diapers do. They feel soft to the touch and seem to also be soft and comfortable to wear without causing any skin irritations. I still think some of the name brands might be a bit softer but not by significant amounts. The absorbency is good for a thin diaper and holds up to nap times without leaking. The value pack seems to offer a pretty good value, and I love that they are made in the USA and that this company gives back, donating over 7 million diapers and wipes to parents in need. That's awesome!"

They are really soft, truly cloth-like texture, strong Velcro tabs, great elastic leak barriers and have a great gender-neutral star design all over.

Nice that they are eco-friendly and hypo-allergenic. Best feature is it\u2019s softer than any diaper I\u2019ve seen. Four stars mostly because of the price and how that compares to others I buy."

And my 8 month old had a leaky diaper after just wearing for 2.5 hours, so definitely wouldn\u2019t trust to have my little ones wear through the night.\nNot only is the quality far lower, but the cost of this pack is double what I pay for R&F for a comparable amount.\nI think the only advantage are these have cuter designs, but I mean my babies\u2019 booties are always covered anyways and the diapers go straight to the trash so I am not super concerned about the look of them.\nThese are fine to have on hand in case you run out or to keep a few in the car for on the go, but I won\u2019t be using these regularly unfortunately"

Additionally, they aren't the easiest to put on. The velcro tabs are the same color as the diaper so figuring out front to back can't be done with a quick glance. This gives my toddler granddaughter just enough time to allegator roll out of position. I need a different color tab or a design element that says \"BACK\" or something. I would get them if I felt super strongly about the toxin issue, but I think I'll reserve that for her food."
