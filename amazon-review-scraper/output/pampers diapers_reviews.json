The pull-on design makes diaper changes so much faster, especially with a squirmy little one who doesn\u2019t want to lie down. The stretchy waistband fits snugly without leaving marks, and it moves with my child, which is perfect for all the running, climbing, and wiggling.\n\nThey\u2019re super absorbent and leak-proof \u2014 we\u2019ve had zero blowouts or overnight leaks since switching to these. Plus, no tape tabs means my toddler can\u2019t rip them off (a huge win!).\n\nIf your little one is on the move and regular diapers just aren\u2019t cutting it, I highly recommend these. They feel like a mix between a diaper and training pants, and they work amazingly well."

The Pampers Baby Dry Diapers \u2013 Size 4 (186 Count) have been a consistent choice for us, providing peace of mind throughout the day and night.\n\nAbsorbency & Leak Protection:\nThese diapers feature Pampers' exclusive LockAway Channels, which effectively absorb wetness and lock it away, ensuring up to 12 hours of dryness. This feature has been particularly beneficial during overnight use, reducing the frequency of nighttime changes and helping our baby sleep more soundly.\n\nSkin Protection:\nThe Dri-Weave Liner helps keep our baby's skin dry and healthy, while the diapers are hypoallergenic and free from parabens, latex, and elemental chlorine. This has been important for us, as our baby has sensitive skin and we've noticed fewer instances of irritation compared to other brands.\n\nFit & Comfort:\nThe stretchy sides provide a secure and comfortable fit, adapting to our baby's movements without causing discomfort. The diapers are also lightweight and thin, making them less bulky under clothing and more comfortable for our active baby.\n\nWetness Indicator:\nThe built-in wetness indicator is a convenient feature, changing color to signal when it's time for a change. This has been especially helpful for us, ensuring we don't miss the signs of a wet diaper.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 Diapers offer a combination of absorbency, skin protection, and comfort that meets our needs. The 186-count pack provides a convenient one-month supply, making it a cost-effective option for our family. If you're looking for a reliable diaper that keeps your baby dry and comfortable, we highly recommend giving these a try."

It was heartbreaking.\nWe\u2019ve been using these for roughly 4 months or so and we won\u2019t go back to anything else.\nThey have a cute design (our one year old will hold a diaper while being changed and take his little pointer finger and point to all the little Sesame Street character and such on them. He sleeps thru the night with them comfortably with minimal times of leakage and that\u2019s only if he drank more that day or he fell asleep super super late and we forgot to change him right before.\nTheir design is cute and their size runs true to size."

They literally started turning her skin raw on day 5. Granted huggies sensitive completely turned the whole touched area by the diaper lobster raw after 1 diapers. Luckily when I had my first daughter hospitals gave out these diapers instead of the new swaddlers sensitive ones like my last 2 kids. So I knew they worked from the beginning a long time ago. I hope this review helps another mom that feels like she is out of option's unfortunately they aren't sold in store at the newborn size anymore but im thankful they are sold on Amazon. I had been cutting size 1 with scissors for about 5 days while we looked all over town for the right size newborns for our fresh newborn . We found out after our hunt they don't stock newborn sizes anymore. Thank you pampers for such an amazing diaper . 4 kids later going strong with baby dry !"

From their soft, cloth-like feel to their excellent absorbency, these diapers truly stand out. The fit is snug yet comfortable, and the stretchy sides ensure they stay in place without being too tight.\nThe wetness indicator is a lifesaver for new parents, providing a clear signal when it's time for a change.\nThe absorbency is impressive, keeping my baby dry and comfortable for hours, even overnight. Plus, the diapers are gentle on sensitive skin, with no signs of irritation or redness.\nAnother great feature is how thin and lightweight they are, without sacrificing performance. They're easy to pack for trips and don't feel bulky under clothing. The light, fresh scent is also a nice touch-not overpowering but just enough to keep things smelling pleasant.\nIf there's one downside, it's that Pampers Swaddlers can be slightly more expensive compared to other brands. However, the quality and performance justify the cost, especially for parents looking for peace of mind.\nOverall, Pampers Swaddlers are a reliable, high-quality choice for keeping your baby comfortable, dry, and happy. Highly recommended!"

You can tell it\u2019s really comfortable as the baby sleeps longer before he\u2019ll get irritated which is when it\u2019s already overflowing. Great design with the yellow lining in the middle turns blue when it\u2019s wet."

This is a top-of-the-line diaper and excels in all ways.\n\nWe use a size 7 though could *probably* get away with a size 6, and use about 4-5 diapers a day on average (not including his overnight diaper) depending on how much he's had to drink and how often he poops -usually once a day, but could be as many as 3 times, especially if he doesn't go one day.\n\nThe first thing you notice about these diapers is how soft they are. I mean, they just feel like they would be comfortable on a child, and since they're in them practically 24/7, that's important. The diaper is mostly white, and the overall designs are more muted than a lot of other diapers, with \"Shilo and Friends\" -an elephant and duck - on the front and back. I personally wouldn't mind something bolder, I don't think my child cares or even notices. There is a wetness indicator that goes down the length of the diaper, front and back. Nice to have I suppose for a caregiver who maybe doesn't change a lot of diapers, but at this age and stage, it's easy to know and tell. Like all Pampers diapers, they are scented. I happen to love the gentle powder-like scent, but it's a turn-off to some who describe it as too strong, and of course, if your child is sensitive to that, you may want to avoid Pampers diapers.\n\nInside, the top sheet liner keeps his skin dry, even when he wets heavily -which is usually - and does a good job of keeping poop from sticking to his bottom. The \"blowout barrier\" in the back also helps contain any messes. In terms of absorbency, I'm pretty amazed at how much they can hold. Being a little older, he tends to stay drier for longer periods and then pee a larger amount at one time, but the diaper almost always holds it in, and leaks are rare.\n\nThe one thing I wish that Pampers did do was have wider tapes, like Huggies, at least on the larger sizes, where kids are more active. It hasn't been a problem, so I don't really have a reason for saying that, other than that it seems like it would help with fit, but it certainly won't keep me from buying or using them in the future."

If you\u2019re looking for a diaper that can keep up with longer wear times, you might want to consider alternatives. However, for a well-established brand with consistent quality, these could still be worth a try if you\u2019re okay with more frequent changes."

I came back to Pampers.\n\nWhat I like about Pampers is that they do not irrate the baby's skin. They have good elastic around the waist and they look great. They are also durable and worth the money. My favo are Pampers Swaddlers. However, I wanted to try these and with these particularly, I have had a few blowouts. Where my baby's po has come all the way up his back. I have also experienced that if the diper is too full when he pees, some of it has passed onto his clothes. This has happened at night 3x. My recommendation is that do not let the diper be full at all. When placing the baby to sleep, even if the diper seems dry or it can hold a lot more pee, change it. Also when baby pops make sure that your arm is putting pressure on their button, this way the poop won't also move up the diper being that there is no extra protective lining as there is on Pampers Swaddlers. I changed back to Swaddlers."

These are diapers I get when I\u2019m in a pinch and I still want a pretty good diaper to use. They hold a lot and keep my baby comfortable and that\u2019s all that matters at the end of the day. I also love how with pampers you get to use the pampers rewards. They\u2019re stretchy and soft on the inside. Compared to swaddlers they are pretty thin but for the price they\u2019re great"

The size 4 seems a bit small in the waist area. My baby wakes up wet all the time from Papers Swadderls, and she did not wake up wet this morning, and i will update more when I use more of these diapers. Thanks!\nUpdated review: diapers are great!!! Pamper swaddlers are better for a moving, crawling baby. But these are the best absorbency of any diaper we have ever used. Easy to use, just wish they would stay in place while she is crawling and moving. Great on skin, just very impressed! Only took away one star due to Mobility but for absorbency they are the best!!! Definitely buy! Thanks Amazon!"

The absorbency is good but depends on your child and how often you change there diaper. One thing I will mention concerning the design compared to other brands. The back of the diaper where your Childs back starts needs to be about 3 inches higher and the elastic needs to support the diaper better in the back. Other brands have a higher back panel of the diaper with more elastic support. Are child is active and needs the extra support. But if you are looking to purchase a good quality diaper that will not leak Pampers would make a good choice for your child."

We bought a combination of Huggies and Pampers, whatever was cheaper for the size we were buying. We learned very quickly that although in the past, the Pampers were inferior to the Huggies, that role has since reversed. We will not buy Huggies for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe one gripe I have, is that this box is NOT a months supply. That is misleading. Do the Math. 12 Boxes of these, will NOT last you a year... those numbers add up to 5 diapers per day (we are using the size 5), and every 3rd day, you get a sixth diaper alloted. (Averaged out over the year). So, a new diaper at wake up, a new one at nap time, a new one at bed time, and that leaves only 2 diaper changes throughout the rest of the day.\n\nMaybe its nitpicky, but I feel like this is false advertising, and it kind of annoys me."

He rarely leaks through the night as long as he's changed right before bed. He doesn't get rashes from this brand, either. My one big issue? When they get wet, the liner of the diaper flakes off, leaving a linty mess all over my son that's not easy to clean off with a wipe because of being stuck to damp skin.

I love the Sesame Street design, and the wetness indicator but these diapers need changed frequently as they tend to bulge in the front. All in all this diaper is great, and held its end of the bargain with the overnight dryness, but by the morning the diaper smells a little like urine."

The baby dry pack I received are just the same as the ones we have in the hospital. Pampers even mentions that baby dry is not as soft as swaddlers. The biggest difference I noticed between the two types other than price is baby dry has more leak protection and absorbency than swaddlers. Most recently I bought swaddlers and I am definitely changing my daughters diaper more often than with baby dry (while still getting the same consumption of food). Swaddlers are definitely softer and have better designs but does not provide as much protection."

Didn\u2019t even open any of the bags yet. Nobody in my household is sensitive to fragrance, thank goodness, but the last thing I need is for my house to smell like one big diaper. Highly advise against gifting these. Wish they were more upfront/clear in their advertising and box design that these diapers are not fragrance free.\nCan\u2019t say anything about absorbency or performance as I refuse to even try these diapers.\nNow I have to figure out what to do with the boxes of size 2 and 3 that were gifted at my baby shower.\nI\u2019m sure these work just great for others, but the smell alone is enough to deter me. I\u2019m a first time mom and have only used Huggies (until now) because that\u2019s what they provided in the hospital and I liked them. Just figured I\u2019d branch out and try another brand to see if I liked these better, and I\u2019m clearly regretting that now."

Normally, we buy the Pampers Pure, but I thought I'd try something different and, a little less pricey. Sometimes newborn's poos are very liquidy more so than pasty, and these diapers don't absorb it very well at all.\n\nOn diaper commercials, they spill a glass of water on a diaper, wait 15 minutes, set the baby down on a colored absorbent cloth, and look, no leaks! ... Right ... yeah, when my daughter poops in these diapers, and I feel it when I'm holding her, I don't wait 15 minutes, I run to the nearest changing table because, if I do wait even 5 minutes, it'll be running up her back and out the legs of one of these dipes. Having her in the car and hearing her shart with these on ... shudder ... it could cause an accident, that's how quickly I have to get to a public restroom. Every time I see a mom, with a baby in the backseat of her car, who looks like shes gonna cry, I wonder if it's because she's in this very predicament.\n\nAnd YET, for pee they work great ... Why is that? They have a (visible) absorbent pad located mostly in the front, which works fantastically for my daughter; holy crap, can she pee a lot.\n\nThe indicator line is absolutely wonderful, and all of Pampers' diapers are equppied with them. I wish the indicator ran through front to back so you could see exactly what type of cleanup you're working with, but ... you know ...\n\nThese also have the velcro tech on the closure tabs, which make it so much easier for readjusting the diaper. All Pampers' diapers have these, too.\n\nI love Pampers, and despite this not being a 5 star review, I like these diapers, I just dont think they're a good design for a newborn's diapers.\n\nI'm giving them 3 stars because, all around, they're a good low cost diaper, but they lack absorbency at a baby's age when parents may need it most."

Also I don\u2019t care for the blue dye color on the inside of the diaper (no, not the indicator dye). One last thing I noticed was the diaper seems thin.\n\nI have tried pampers swaddles and pure, and I think I like those better. I have also tried Huggies, which seem a little thicker too.\n\nI think this pamper diaper is comparable to LUVS.\nIf you like LUVS you\u2019ll like this one.

This brand of pampers is a bit cheaper so I was hoping I could switch, but if it's going to leave red marks on my baby's hips/sides then forget it. It's not worth it. Also in regard to mama bear-pampers absorb better than mama bear but mama bear does not absorb better. Mama Bear gets these gel balls after my baby has peed in the diaper. Gross and messy but they are cheaper and not worst so it's good alternative."

I recommend Sizing up if you are buying these for cost. I presume they\u2019d work better if sized up. Not good for chubby babies!

He wears diapers to sleep and for long car rides. Wearing diapers in these situations does not adversely affect his potty training. During the day he's in regular underwear. I haven't needed pull-ups since my first child when I bought into the belief that they needed pull-ups to feel like a big kid and that wearing diapers at night would somehow hurt their progress. (I have 4 and my toddler boy is the youngest.) He usually doesn't pee until morning. I haven't had any problems with leaks or rashes with these but they do fill up pretty fast. I try to only buy pampers because I've never had any issues with their diapers. I would strongly recommend the brand to anyone. I would recommend these for toddlers who aren't going to be running around in wet diapers anyway. I would not recommend them for younger babies who pee a lot overnight but maybe the smaller sizes are more absorbent. I bought size the 4 pack of 186 diapers. These were 49.99 before taxes but 52.99 after. They shipped to Maryland. I never select the subscribe and save option. I ordered them on a Friday and got on Monday with 2-day shipping. They were shipped with USPS and the box appeared to be in good condition."

But when we started using these on my 18 month old, the leakage protection is non-existent. He usually don't leak out the top or the sides, but urine will seep through the front panel of the diaper. Don't get me wrong, sometimes my kid pees like a racehorse and it's understandable that there's some leakage with that amount of urine. But it's almost daily, no matter if he pees twice or twenty times throughout the night. I've had to do quite a few extra loads of laundry since using this round of baby-dry diapers.\n\nWe've also had a few that busted at the seams without the diaper being too full & the gel got everywhere. Maybe it's just the baby-dry or this shipment but I won't be buying the baby-dry again.\n\nThat being said, I am still a big fan of the pampers swaddles & the wipes will forever be my favorite!"

It dawned on me that I would never leave my baby in a soiled diaper for 12 hours; with the indicator strip diapers I could change his diaper every time he was wet, but now I might go a couple of hours without changing because I don't realize he's urinated and then I feel bad (I'm a new mom, so pretty much anything makes me feel bad).\n\nAlso he has had some leakage (stool & urine) if he's laying on his side (during feedings or just a quick nap next to mommy). I thought maybe I'm not using the diapers properly, but it's happened a couple of times when I've had seasoned moms change him.\n\nI bought the 104 pack and diapers aren't cheap, so of course I'm going to use them up, but I'm going back to Pampers Swaddlers after this."

Our baby did not do well with the mesh fabric. At just under 6 lbs, he swims in the swaddlers and the baby dry and the mesh fabric chafes at his delicate skin. So these were better for being such a small baby.\n\nWe do miss the wetness indicator but these puff up at wetness or soiling and are easier to tell when he's had an movement through clothes. I can feel for hardness as an indication through clothes better than the swaddlers. Which is nice when our baby is bundled under clothes that are hard to undo. The velcro closure isn't in the yellow and we do fumble for tabs when we're trying to finish closing our baby.\n\nSo although not a perfect diaper for the parents, our baby is comfortable and dry. Even at 5lbs 11oz and runny stool from breastfeeding he hasn't had a leak."

His huggies would fill up quicker but they didnt seap through like these do. We even switched to Pampers overnights because they work great and are bigger than huggies"

Pampers, my long time go-to, the diaper I always went back to after trying others, is no longer my go to. They must have changed, because suddenly they\u2019re average at best, at least their most economic \u201cbaby dry\u201d style. The absorption is not as good as it was (I used to be able to use them as overnight diapers even!) and worse, the TABS. They don\u2019t stay stuck anymore. My older two would come over to me to let me know their diaper was falling off. A couple times my daughter was running and thump, diaper completely fell off. Diapers were not too full, either.\nAt first, I thought it might be a bad box. Or, on occasion you see reviews on Amazon where reviewers think diapers might be \u201cknock offs.\u201d So I got another couple bags of Pampers from my local grocery store. Same deal. More leaks and tabs that just won\u2019t stay attached. I no longer recommend these Pampers Baby Dry diapers. I change my 5 star rating down to a whopping 2 star.\n\nOriginal review: Pampers are the most reliable diapers I've tried with my now 16 month old son, hands down.\nI enjoy trying different varieties of diapers and even comparing the same diapers in different countries. My son was born in Italy and we moved to the US when he was 10 months old. In Italy we tried Pampers, Huggies, Amazon, and grocery store brand. In the US we've tried Pampers, Pampers Pure, Amazon, Sam's Club, Hello Bello, Dyper, and Honest.\nFor context, my son is a higher percentile (big), heavy-wetting baby. We had plenty of leaks when he was younger. Once we found that Pampers never leaked, we stuck with those, or kept them as overnight diapers if I couldn't find a good price on them. Now that we're in the US, I've found that Pampers are still the best. Interestingly enough, the Italian and American Pampers are slightly different. The protection and absorption are mostly the same, the main difference beyond the prints is how the American Pampers \"fuzz\" after they've been on for a bit. Not a big deal at all, but interests me to know why, and maybe there are more differences than meet the eye.\nYay for Pampers around the world!"

The fabric barely absorbs liquid, both of my kiddos are damp every time I change the diaper.

Purchased the \"improved\" ones from both Amazon and Wal-Mart, thought maybe the first box from Amazon was a bad batch. If you don't wanna read my rant, look at review pictures and that's what happened to me. Pee diaper fluff everywhere each morning. Baby got diaper rash.\n\nI've been using the Baby Dry diapers for over 2 years and definitely noticed the difference in their \"new\" diapers. I have a 2 \u00bd and a 1 year old and they both used to be able to sleep through the night with the old ones. I'm talking 12hrs straight because that's just how they sleep. Diaper would be FULL but intact by some magical diaper force. Like scary full. Sometimes they would poop. Yet, no leaks! And no rashes. Ordered these new ones and hahahaha...yeah. EVERY MORNING diaper fluff all over my 1yr old's legs and belly. My optimistic butt tried them for 6 days. Even woke him up for a diaper changes in the middle of the night a couple nights and still happened. Like MAAAAYBE 4-5 hours overnight then it has to be changed. Poor baby got a nasty rash because I kept giving them a try.\nSo I thought, maybe it's just a bad batch from Amazon. So I picked some up at Wal-Mart. Nope. Same problem. So now I'll be returning 3 boxes of diapers and might have to switch to Swaddlers or the Movers or just switch brand. But if you need them for just daytime wear, go for it. Just watch out for it exploding overnight."

I decided to give a chance to baby dry diapers but have been nothing but bad they leak and don't conform with my child's waist or legs every time he crawls it falls.

After all the disappointing changes they had been to diapers that I was hearing left and right I thought I would be safe with my son using Pampers. 3 months ago (My son at 20 months old) I was forced to go through 3 different day time options because my son started getting horrible rashes along his thighs and back PLUS the diapers started to leak. After his rash went away with the day time I bought a new box of the night time diapers and I thought it please don't change the extra protection line and yup..My son( 2 yr old )has been using this Kanteen for almost now along with a neoprene sleeve from Kidzikoo to drink water from and I love it! He can hold it with no problem, drinks from it with no issues...woke up with rashes on his thighs again. Leaks left and right. I used LUVS when my son was an infant and these diapers are now comparable to what LUVS USED to be (because they have also become completely terrible diapers). However it is that they make their cruisers line I hope they do not change anything about them because those are the higher priced diapers I've ended up using that actually work and don't give my son a rash so far for both day and night time."

So I tried these. To my surprise they didn't fit very well and were not designed well. The tab that you fold out over the front side to stick the diaper on your baby sits a full inch below the top of the back on the diaper. As such there is this weird open area and we found that our baby girl peed all over everything multiple times in these diapers becuase of that design at the back. They are also smaller than every other brand of size 2 we've tried. Which is not less than probably 10 brands."

I thought, same diaper, different size - what could go wrong? Right? EVERYTHING! All of the sudden, there is no wetness indicator on the diapers! Why would they have them on size 2 and not on size 3? Do I all of the sudden not need to be able to see right away if my baby's diaper is wet? I mean, they still work to soak up poop and pee, but it is harder to tell in the middle of the night. VERT ANNOYING!!!! Also, what is up with the strong fragrance? It reminds me of when stinky guys with bad B.O. just spray cologne on instead of showering. Don't try so hard to cover up the smell!"

No more wrestling with diaper tapes while your baby performs acrobatic stunts on the changing table. These pull-on diapers are like the yoga pants of the diaper world: stretchy, comfy, and they stay put. Seriously, I\u2019m convinced my baby could go bungee jumping and these things would still be secure.\n\nBut here\u2019s the real magic: the *Blowout Barrier*. I\u2019m no diaper expert, but I\u2019m pretty sure this is what\u2019s standing between my baby and the chaos of a full-on \"explosion.\" Wetness? Locked away. Leaks? Never heard of her. I\u2019m pretty sure Pampers Cruisers 360\u00b0 are made of some kind of diaper sorcery. Plus, they\u2019re hypoallergenic and free of all the bad stuff, so you don\u2019t have to worry about your baby\u2019s skin getting a surprise.\n\nIt\u2019s like they took everything that was annoying about diapers, fixed it, and handed us the ultimate solution. If your baby\u2019s a wiggle monster or a midnight diaper-remover, these are your new best friend. 10/10, would diaper-change again."

We switched to cruisers when she started crawling then the cruiser 360 when I had to fight for my life to get a diaper on her lol yall know that stage where they have infinite strength haha I accidentally ordered these one day & I say accidentally cuz I didn\u2019t know they had swaddled 360s , I thought I was ordering the same cruisers. They came & I was so confused lol but I\u2019m so glad cuz I absolutely love them & wish I would\u2019ve realized sooner . The fit is so much better than the cruisers. Putting the 2 next to each you can see the size difference. They are lot softer too."

She wears a size 3 and there\u2019s still room for her to probably stay in them for a while. We\u2019ve had no leaking issues. She stays dry she can stay in a diaper all night and not wake up so these are definitely worth your money and I would buy the big box because they are awesome"

I was concerned that taking them off would be messy, but they tear along the seams really easily.\n\nThen I wondered how to wrap them up to seal in the ick before disposing, but there is a strip on the back of the diaper you can use to secure the soiled diaper. Another plus for grandparents and new parents is that the back of the diaper is marked clearly. This is important because of how the design allows for more absorption in the areas where the mess and liquid will be concentrated.\n\nI sent my granddaughter home in one and her mom reported that there was only a tiny leak in the morning on the back of the diaper, but not significant enough to be concerned or remove a star.\n\nOne thing to mention is that with these diapers, its pretty impossible to put them back on in the case of a \"false alarm\" so be sure to check carefully that a change is warranted before ripping it off!"

Even though my son is now wearing a size 4 with most diapers, these size 3s fit great. My son is 18.5 pounds and it says that the size 3 for this diaper should fit until 28 pounds.\n\nThey are very easy to pull up even though they fit tightly to prevent leaks.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I have totally figured out the pull tab you use to take it off but they are also easy to take off.\n\nVery absorbent.\n\nThe only reason they get a 4 instead of a 5 is that they have a horrible baby powder type fragrance fairly heavily sprayed on them. I would be much more certain about reordering them if they have a fragrance free option, because I do really like the design.\n\nEDIT: I have upgraded this product from four to five stars because the fragrance has grown on me. Probably because the design is so good. I still don\u2019t prefer the fragrance but it also isn\u2019t so bad that I can\u2019t benefit from using these excellent pull up diapers. It has now started to smell more like vanilla, Dr Pepper, and baby powder."

These are great for those littles that are always on the move, and wiggly too! But again, they are PULL-ON diapers and not your traditional diaper.

For name brand diapers, they are kind of thin so we have to change baby more frequently and make sure we clean him very well with each diaper change to get the fuzz out of creases, folds, and such. These diapers are pricey compared to other brands that are more absorbent, cleaner all around, and softer. I have noticed that the leg holes are not made for chunky babies. The elastic digs into my son, even when sizing up. These leak very easily as well. Especially if baby has a blowout, folding the back down doesn't help at all. I just feel like Pampers aren't what they used to be in terms of quality. It seems the price keeps going up while quality goes down. I can get double the amount of diapers in other brands for the price of pampers, and the other diapers are better all around."

When I briefly tried to use Huggies, my son would constantly pee through his diapers. I also briefly used the Costco Kirkland diapers, which were okay. These, hands down, are the best. And they're cheaper on Amazon than they are at my local grocery store!\n\nAfter my son was born, a friend of mine gave me a great tip - when your baby sleeps put them in a diaper that is one size larger, and it helps them sleep through the night. I started it early on, and my son slept through the night at four weeks. I swear part of it had to do with these super absorbent diapers. When he was really little and I didn't size up, he would wake up more often. He's 19 months old now and sleeps lie,my rock, but sizing up early on made a huge difference. And these are such great diapers, I never had to worry about leaks."

Now I love their wipes and for a while, I loved their diapers too, but before too long, she started soaking her clothes during the day. I figured it was time to go up a size. I moved my 22 lb. one year old to size fives and the leaking persisted. So here I am, two sizes later, back to where I started.

The convenience factor of arriving home to a large box of diapers cannot be beat. I've found the prices to be competitive with other retailers (with coupons). As far as the diapers themselves go, I switched from Pampers Swaddlers when my daughter was about 8-9months old and started to wet through her diapers at night. I've found that the Baby Dry version absorbs more, and seems to keep her dry better than some of the other brands. We use the Pampers baby dry diapers during the day, and Huggies Overnight diapers at night."

Now, he recommends Pamper's all the way.\n\nThey are comfortable. They don't feel cheap. They don't leak except for the explosions every now and then - which I think would be the case with any company. They don't smell foul. Huggies diapers would smell right away even if it was just a little tinkle.\n\nI recommend these after your child is done with Pampers Swaddlers (those are my all time favorite)."

Fast forward to not to my 19 month old son, we have also only used pampers baby dry, however about 2 months ago pampers baby dry made an \"upgrade\" to their diaper design, this is what their customer representative I communicated with told me after I had bought a brand new box and my son ended up getting soaking wet the first night with the new design. I still had a couple of diapers of the older version and compared them and reached out to pampers to tell them that I though they had packed the wrong diapers because the older version was ticker and held much better, again, I have used Pampers baby dry for years! Since them I have bought 2 more boxes with the hopes that it would work for us again, as it did for years, but I have to change my son's clothes at least twice a night because the pee goes through everywhere. I have sized up as well, but still the same issue. Please pampers, go back to your prior product, the new one is garbage!!! Unfortunately I am going to have to change brands now, I hope I can find the right replacement."

Actually, we noticed the characters on the diaper changed and the diaper also was super thin, I thought maybe they modified the products and made it better. Now I think they DO change their materials but only made it worse! I also compared the new box and the previous ones, found the old ones were made in USA and the new box one were made in Mexico. I've attached images of the old diapers we had vs. the new ones that I am pointing to. I will change to buy the diapers from local supermarket not from Amazon."

Between my last shipment a few months ago and this one, Pampers reformulated this diaper. The new product is thinner and does not work. I was unpleasantly surprised to wake up to wet PJs on my 1.5 year old for the first time in almost a year. Now I have to find a new diaper or buy some pad inserts so I don\u2019t have to wash clothes every day. We\u2019re busy enough as it is so having something like this happen is incredibly annoying. Why did they feel the need to change a product that was good? DO NOT BUY!"

So you have this gooey clear looking gel (except it looks a light yellow because of the pee) coming out from the sides. I am throwing the rest away.

The only reason I could tell they are actually from Pampers is because the rewards code worked on their website. The diapers looked completely different, had characters from Plaza S\u00e9samo, were SUPER thin, and did not keep my toddler dry through the night. While we've had occasional leaks before this was different.. it leaked in the belly area which has never happened before but also is not surprising since there is hardly any padding in these diapers. Paper thin and scratchy feeling!\n\nOur guess is these diapers were manufactured by Pampers and made much cheaper for other countries. The characters on the diapers are from a different version of Sesame St. My guess is these do not meet USA standards as they weren't produced for this country. We decided not to risk using these with our daughter and will no longer be purchasing diapers through Amazon since you can't know what you'll be getting. I've attached an image of the old diapers we had vs. the new ones that I am pointing to.\n\nIf you receive junky diapers like we did contact Amazon and they will refund your money. We will be purchasing through Walmart or Target from now on to guarantee we don't receive these thin, scratchy diapers again."

This style may be ok for sedentary babies, but not for walkers! We had leaks every single day in these diapers!"

My baby is chunky and I find their diapers to run very narrow. This wasn\u2019t an issue early on, but as he\u2019s grown, their narrow cut has resulted in more blowouts and I found we needed to put him in a size too big just to get a comfortable fit. The fit was still \u201coff\u201d and of course, sizing up means fewer diapers per bundle, which I wasn\u2019t happy about. I\u2019ve spent the last couple of weeks trying other brands in hopes of finding a better fit.\n\nI really wanted to use a diaper made with as few toxic ingredients as possible. Unfortunately, most \u201ceco conscious\u201d diapers fit like Honest\u2019s - narrow, which I think is best for a long, skinny baby. I found Seventh Generation, Babyganics and Earth\u2019s Best all to have a similar shape. Earth\u2019s Best performed particularly well from an absorportion standpoint, so if you have a long and skinny baby you might try those.\n\nDiscouraged by the fit of those other brands, I tried Huggies Little Snugglers and Pampers Gentle Care (FYI Gentle Care was comfirmed by P&G as being the exact same diaper as Sensitive Care, just sold exclusively at Target). Both fit well! However, Huggies puts these obnoxious double grip tabs on their diapers beginning with size 3 which can rub against a baby\u2019s thigh, causing serious irritation (check out reviewers\u2019 photos to see what I\u2019m talking about). Pampers Gentle Care fit great and contained mess well, but my baby got a mild rash - his first ever - which I suspect was from the fragrance. This reinforced my desire to use a diaper with healthier ingredients.\n\nI was ready to resign myself to using an ill-fitting diaper like Honest or Earth\u2019s Best when I came across these brand new diapers and I am SO glad I gave Pampers another try. Initial reaction is that these are the same size and shape as Pampers Gentle Care (and, I\u2019d think, regular Pampers Swaddlers) and are also just as soft. NONE of the eco-conscious diapers I\u2019ve tried are soft, so this is amazing! The print is cute without being obnoxious, and the inside contains the same mesh liner as other Pampers. So far, I\u2019m thrilled.\n\nIf your baby is sensitive to Pampers fragrance, or you have a chunky baby but want to try a healthier disposable, I strongly suggest checking these out! I just hope that Amazon soon offers subscribe and save, as these are quite pricey compared to other diapers in this category - even a bit more than Honest when purchased in their monthly bundle.\n\nSee my photo for a visual comparison of this diaper against Honest size 4, Earth\u2019s Best size 4 (top row, left to right) and Honest size 3 and Pampers Gentle Care size 3 (bottom row). The Pure Protection size 3 is the diaper in the middle of the bottom row."

They have yet to leak, are truly sensitive skin proof and still have the Pampers 12 hour protection... on even the chubbiest thighs! The design is sweet and simple and doesn't push gender OR branding WHICH WE LOVE. She can share a Pamper during a playdate with anyone! Pics are included as proof of how happy our princesa is!\n\nWhile I miss the sweet baby smell of Swaddlers, I love the wet indicator on these going past size 2. They are so close to cloth, the only thing better would be them being biodegradable!"

Then we switched Honest diapers for about a year but the fit just isn't great and they always leak overnight. Now we have landed on these Pamper's Pure diapers for the time being for our 20 month old. I wish they were more biodegradable and they aren't quite as \"pure\" as I would like, but dang they work well! They are soft, they can *usually* last overnight (the Honest Overnights almost always leaked for us, and these ones leak maybe once a week) and they fit really well. It's also nice to just have one diaper for night and day, not that that's a huge deal. As a parent I feel like we can never win, something is always toxic or bad in some product so I'm sure no matter what we do we'll always hesitate a bit with everything we buy. But overall we have been really happy with these and I'm glad they are at least a step up from a normal diaper as far as healthy ingredients go."

I used the Swaddlers with my first kid a few years ago exclusively because they worked so well. I just had another baby and started to think about using more natural products for this one. I tried a few of the other brands that tout this, but wasn't happy because they didn't hold in all of the leaks. I received a gift card to try out the new Pampers Pure diapers so ordered these to give it a try. So far - they are great! They offer the same protection from leaks that I know and love from Pampers diapers, but I love that these have no lotions or fragrances. Definitely recommend these for parents looking for a more natural option!"

I\u2019ve tried honest diapers and liked them but not as much as pampers, so the thought of a safer version of the diaper we already use was a win. I\u2019ll admit they\u2019re pretty pricey but they are by far my favorite diaper we\u2019ve ever used so I\u2019ll continue to buy them as long as the budget allows it. They\u2019re so so soft, have no smell and super cute too. I also found they\u2019re a tad bigger. I was considering sizing my son up but I can definitely keep his same size now and have even thought of trying a sample pack in the size down since you get more diapers in smaller sizes. Haven\u2019t had any issues with the diaper tabs like some have said. So overall even though they\u2019re pricey, I feel they\u2019re worth it."

My girl is about 21 pounds and we wear size 5."

We already love Pampers, and I really liked the idea of this bundled pack of baby-changing necessities: You get four of the pop-top packages of 56ct wipes (total of 224) and four 27ct packages of Size 3 diapers (total of 108!) I was intrigued by the \"Pure\" line, as we have been moving to more natural diaper options.. I like that these are fairly neutral colored print so they don't show under clothing: one design features two adorable otters, and the other design is an all-over milk-bottle print. The materials used for each competent of the diaper are clearly listed on the packaging, something I've never seen before! I really appreciate that this line is hypoallergenic, and without chlorine or bleach processing, latex, synthetic fragrances or lotions and without all 26 of the EU 26 Allergens. They are also thin (not bulky) but are very absorbent. My little one has sensitive skin and is prone to diaper rashes, but has not had any issues with these diapers. These actually fit my baby comfortably she is 25 lbs, even though she is at the top end of the recommended 16-28 lbs range. Also -- they still have the \"wetness indicator\" ! We use baby wipes for everything from standard diaper changes, to grimy/sticky hand cleaning, to theatre/dance make-up removal; and these Pure Protection wipes are great. They, too, are hypoallergenic, and free of phenoxyethonol, parabens, perfume, dye and alcohol. These have a very mild, barely-there, clean scent. These wipes have a nice weight to them, and are woven well with a very slight texture - they are actually really stretchy and very soft, like cloth. They are a good size and very durable. The wipes packet perfect for a purse or diaper bag, and the flip-top is nice - it is easy to remove just one wipe without pulling out the whole pack! My little one has sensitive skin and is prone to diaper rashes, but has not had any issues with these diapers or wipes. The price is a little high, but we will probably Subscribe & Save for convenience and quality of this line."

I like the fact that they left out the things that babies skin can be sensitive to. The big thing for me was having 4 packs of diapers as well as 4 packs of wipes come all in the same box. Seems to be a very convenient way of getting them, instead of taking baby, buckling her into the car seat, get to the store and then unbuckling her to take her into the store just for a diaper run, when you can order them, and the mailperson will deliver them straight to your door. A convenience that is certainly worth it to many moms. I'm looking forward to seeing how they work out with my grandbaby.\n\nDisposable diapers can really do a number on a baby's skin. I remember once that we were at a family get together and one of the moms had wandered off and left behind her baby who was getting increasingly fussy. We noticed his diaper was soaking wet and we changed it. That poor little guy had a bright red rash everywhere the diaper had touched, and it was drenched. When the mom came back she was mad that we had changed him into his very last diaper! If you can't afford to keep you little one in sufficient disposable diapers, then use cloth from the beginning. Over time they are so much cheaper than disposables. But just because a disposable can hold a lot of fluid, doesn't mean it should. Your babies skin is too delicate. Be sure you have sufficient diapers on hand always and change them as needed. Getting them in a pack like this help prevent the running out of diapers dilemma."

The elastic clings but not in way that leaves marks. The rise in the front and the back is perfect for stopping any unwanted leaks and messes. Note that these do have a wetness indicator.\n\nThese are unscented which is important to us. We are sensitive to certain scents in our home so no weird perfumed diapers here!\nMy little one hasn't broken out at all when using these. I am pleased with no rashes, itching, or other skin irritations. I love they are made are made without chlorine bleaching, fragrance, lotion, parabens, and EU 26 allergens!\n\nThese are soft to the touch and can hold a good amount of wetness but I don't suggest using them overnight if you have a heavy wetter because it will seep a little if overly full.\n\nThese rest pretty slim under most clothes which is nice and don't break or detach when my little one is jumping, running and wiggling around.

We've been using Pampers swaddlers and cruisers for years (2 kids), but have tried almost every other diaper. I would say these are somewhat of a cross between honest diapers and pampers. They have a cute, subtle design and are hypoallergenic. The design does not easily show through clothing like other, bright designs. They have a great fit just like regular pampers. These do have the wetness indicator line like the swaddlers that honest and cruisers do not. They are also a lot softer than the honest or earth's best diapers! For absorbency, I would compare it more to the swaddlers. I prefer using cruisers for nighttime, heavy wetness.\n\nIf you do the math, I believe they are comparable to other sensitive/natural brands. If you are used to regular pampers prices, these are a little higher. I would say they are worth the price if you do subscribe and save to get more for your money. Very nice that you can get both diapers and wipes (in about the right amount too) in one order!\n\nAs far as the wipes go, these are nice. A lot like water wipes. But in my opinion, nothing beats the costco baby wipes!"

The diapers are very similar to the Pampers Swadlers that we have used and love. We have had no issues with leaks or adsorption problems. These diapers seem a little lighter and softer than others, so we were initially skeptical. Overall, these diapers are great.\n\nThe wipes have no scent and the material is a soft woven material. I'm not a huge fan of these wipes. They are almost too soft to clean great. Bottom line, these wipes are good for wet diapers. If you have a poopie - might want to break out the Brillo Pad wipes - because these really take some scrubbing since they are so soft.\n\nOur favorite and most unexpected like on these is that the diaper package have a handle on the top of them. It makes it nice to open the package and have a handle that you can carry it around with. I know this is small, but we like it. Makes it easier to get all the baby supplies when you have your hands full of baby."

Our family has recently become very conscious of the products we use, checking the ewg website for things like shampoos, soaps, sunscreen, etc. I feel like I want to be extra cautious with my children, so a natural diaper is very much appreciated.

They seem to slip out of the packaging much easier than with the other sensitive wipes I was using. So the one downfall is the cost of this product.

The core of the diaper is made from chlorine-free fluff pulp, mineral-based odor absorber and super absorbent polymer. The polymer absorbent lasts up to 12 hours and in our testing works very well.\n\nThere is a wetness indicator which reacts when urine touches the H-Sensitive Strip.\n\nThe diapers fit well and the wipes are alcohol, fragrance & parabens free.\n\nYou get 108 count diapers (Size 3) and 224 wipes split into 4 packages.\n\nThe whole package comes out to be a bit expensive if you are buying it as a one time purchase. My recommendation, join Amazon family to save 20% on diapers or use subscribe and save to save up to 15%. Also make sure to clip the coupon for a few dollars off as well."

They were soft and have adorable prints.\nI like having the wetness indicator, although my daughter is 2 and at this age it isn't a huge priority.\nI tried the diapers for various intervals throughout the day and even overnight. There were never any leaks of any sort. I also liked that they didn't leave red marks as I've had happen before.\nThese diapers are on the more expensive side, but you get what you pay for. I was impressed and would buy these again."

With that being said they're not as great as I hoped they would be. They are not very absorbent, and in no way would last 12 hours. After wearing them for one hour or less if I take them off after the baby has peed The inside is VERY wet and cannot be comfortable for the baby. They are not absorbent enough.\nAndy Pandy is definitely better in absorption. However I feel Andy Pandy is stiffer than the pampers diapers. I may try them a little bit longer because I have a very gassy baby that needs to move around, but for overnight these will not last. Hopefully Pampers can improve this. I would also recommend them moving that mesh layer on the inside I really hate it."

I tried the sensitive Swaddlers with good results, but still rash. I found Pampers Premium care on clearance and they by far were the best we\u2019ve used. Unfortunately neither the Premium Care nor the Swaddlers Sensitive are available.\n\nI was excited to try the Pampers Pure and went to a few stores to find them. I find that the fit is decent and they are soft. Unfortunately, though, we have had horrible compression leaks when my daughter is in her car seat or napping. While I know she is a heavy wetter, we did not have this issue with the Swaddlers sensitive or the Premium care. Unfortunately, I will have to purchase another box of these to make it until our cloth diapers arrive."

I came across the Pampers Pure Protection and tried the size 4 on my 2 year old.\nThe Pampers is nowhere near as good as Bambo Nature. Like other reviewers have mentioned it doesn't hold wetness well. When my daughter pees it feels very wet on the surface unlike the Bambo diapers which absorb wetness very well and feel much drier on the surface next to my child's skin. It also sags and she often pulls at it because it makes her feel uncomfortable.\nThe Pampers costs as much as the Bambo (with Subscribe & save) so if the price is fine with you, I strongly advise that you try Bambo Nature instead."

I also felt that they smelled funny as soon as they became wet. Lastly when they were wet they leaked. The first time we used one was when we ran someplace and I had to change a wet kid and wipe out a carseat because of how bad they leaked. Could of been the size difference but I was not a fan of these and would not purchase these myself. I gave it two stars because they seemed very soft and gentle, so i did like that aspect of them."
